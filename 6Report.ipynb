    "### Information about the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project wrangles the data of Shakopee, MN area. I have lived in Minnesota for nearly a decade. So It's like my hometown. As the \"Shakopee.osm\" file is 70 MB only, I have used the complete file for analysis. It's downloaded from openstreetmap.org. It is an open-source project, which provides a free map for the entire world from volunteer-entered data. OpenStreetMap data is freely available to download in many formats and it gives an ideal opportunity to practice the art of data wrangling.\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "This Analysis is a requirement for Data Wrangling Project from Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree.\n",
    "####  Purpose:\n",
    "The file is very big and it contains thousands of rows. So editing and updating the wrong data is a difficult task. And also it's  difficult to work manually on the data provided. \n",
    "So we have to automate the process of:\n",
    "* Downloading and Extraction of OSM, XML files\n",
    "* Exploring, auditing and cleaning the data.\n",
    "* After cleaning extracting the data into CSV files\n",
    "* Connecting to database\n",
    "* Running SQL queries\n",
    "* And report your findings"

    "###### The actual behavior of the interface:\n",
    "* Looks like the software is accepting any letter, number, character for many of the fields.\n",
    "* Playground name field starts with small letters\n",
    "* Name field starts with small letters.\n",
    "* Postcode field allows letters, numbers, and combination too.\n",
    "* Fax field allows letters and numbers\n",
    "* Unit field allows special characters\n",
    "* City name field allows a State Name.\n",
    "* Age field allows any character or number.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Expected behavior of the interface:\n",
    "*When we develop a data entering interface:\n",
    "* When we enter values in the fields, They should have some restrictions like:\n",
    "* Name should start with uppercase letter\n",
    "* Age should be in numbers\n",
    "* Postcode should be in numbers\n",
    "* The phone number should be in numbers\n",
    "* Fax should be in numbers.\n",
    "* City field should not accept a State name.\n",
    "* Auto-population of cities, states, countries will help.\n",
    "* Streets can include numbers and letters both.\n",
    "* After entering the wrong data for at least important fields like \"age\", it should disable the upload field option.\n",
    "* But It allows the user to update the changes.\n",
    "* For a better data: Review from an expert for every contribution and approval helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "* Data entered will be consistent and easily understandable.\n",
    "* It helps in cleaning the data easily.\n",
    "* It saves more time for the users, who contribute to the maps and also who analyzes the data.\n",
    "* Clean data and accurate data means better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anticipated Problems:\n",
    "* For each and every country the fields and the values for the data will be different. So keeping everything in a single format is not a good idea.\n",
    "* Ex: \n",
    "* Phone numbers in the US have a 10-digit format.\n",
    "* Phone numbers in India for cell numbers it's a 10-digit format.\n",
    "* Phone numbers in India for landline numbers it's 11-digit format.\n",
    "* As people in different countries speak the different languages, People will try to edit maps in their own language. \n",
    "* So if we take large datasets of 2 different countries, if the languages are different, it's really difficult to analyze the data.\n",
    "* So again maintaining a consistent format for all over the world is difficult. \n",
    "* But we can be country specific."

    "I have tried to clean few variables like cities, streets, states, postal codes and phone numbers. Remaining variables like Counties, Cuisine, Hospitals etc.. also needs exploration, audition, and cleaning. So we can say that the analysis of the data of Shakopee, MN is still incomplete. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we take \" k value\" as postcode only. It's ignoring many values tagged or named differently like postal_code, tiger_zip_code1, tiger_zip_right1 and tiger_zip_left1 etc...\n",
    "These values can also be included for further investigation and cleaning.\n",
    "So that important places related to these zip codes can be included in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the zip codes were tagged under one name, it would be easier for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as in the above suggestion, a better Data Entry interface helps us keep the data in a format which is easily understandable and analyzed by all."
